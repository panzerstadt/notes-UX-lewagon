UX
----
- its purpose is to create a ficitonal charater that represents the type of users
- the narrower your customer segment, the easier it is going to be to target them
- understand what the user is
- and understand his/her current state of mind

STEPS
-----
1. clear pitch
2. clear persona
3. customer journey / flow

needs
-------
- basic info
- their goals
- typical behaviours
	- to put yourself in the shoes of the potential customer

where to find users
----------------
- google
	- blog research
- customer interviews

use case - UberEats
-------------------
a basic info (ubereats use case)
- name
- nickname
- age
- nationality
- lives in
- job
- relationship status
- income

detailed goals
- save time for lunch
- find out about new foods
- etc

typical behaviours
- define current behaviour (when the service has not yet launched)
- also define updated typical behavious (when heis using the service)
	- so study that this is something that will evolve over time

	- current behaviour
		- eats at his desk
		- food from a yoshinoya
		- take away
		- eats within 15 minutes
		- has meetings throughout the whole day
		- reads Nikkei every morning
			- so targeted ads can be on Nikkei, because from research this is where the target customer is
	- updated behaviour (after service is launched)
		- eats from the one that delivers the fastest
		- will usually go for bestsellers (because he is stressed)
		- (deeper) never gets any add-ons with his meal

user journey
- focus is only on the CORE user journey
	- you have a bunch of user journeys
		- e.g. airbnb has a 100 over user journeys
		- but the core user journey is
			- booking an apartment
		- other user journeys are
			- looking for experiences
			- chatting with the owner
			- updating your profile

Tanaka san
- goal : save time before a meeting
	- that is his main goal
- here it is important to define a context
	- right now he is at his desk
	- it's 1pm
	- he's alone at his desk
	- which device is he using? (extremely important for web dev)
		- his desktop
	- what's his mood
		- stressed
		- in a hurry
		- hungry
		- therefore he's not gonna give you much attention

core user journey: ordering food
- also describe his feeling throughout the journey
- generally requires some iteration because we don't get things right the first time
- steps
	- search for food delivery service
		- FEELING: hungry
	- select UberEats
		- FEELING: hopeful
		- here we go back to the persona
	- the app asks him where he is
		- FEELING: neutral
		- enter his current location
		- if he's on mobile (and you're sure) then location is automatic
	- he will pick form the top rated restaurants in the day that can deliver in within 15 minutes (or sorted by distance)
		- FEELING: neutral
		- because he only picks from good places
	- he will select his meal
		- FEELING: hopeful
		- he will mostly select only the bestsellers
	- he can click on pay immediately
		- FEELING: neutral
		- because he usually doesn't pick side orders
	- wait for his food
		- FEELING: impatient
		- stare at his screen for 15 minutes
	- here the ubereats app has a bike that shows realtime location of the delivery bike
		- reduces stress
		- worry about not knowing when the food is going to arrive

order flow / user flow
- https://whimsical.co/AGPFZ2h4o9u6bSAqFaN3yz
- each item has only one single action
- when you design your webapp you want to have a clear action that your user is going to do
- you are losing customers at every single step
	- only a small portion of people will get to your last page
	- so shorten the flow

wireframing
- https://www.figma.com/file/dICTaf2kZ0xNtbAE3QngiTLs/mi-travel-free-sketch-template?node-id=0%3A1
- usually 2-3 user journeys (with wireframe) in 1 day

measure and learn
- how to measure acquisition
- how to get more customers
